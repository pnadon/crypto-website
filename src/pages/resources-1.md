# Morse Code
[Link to what it is and how it works](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/radio/morse/)

Example:
`.... .. ....... - .... . .-. .` becomes `hi there`

# Polyalphabetic Ciphers
[Link to what it is](https://medium.com/blockgeeks-blog/cryptography-for-dummies-part-3-polyalphabetic-ciphers-c6fbefa3f06c)
[Link to how it works](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/polyalpha/polyalpha.html)

Example:
- Keyword: `BOB`
- Ciphertext: `TSDSSU NSTTOHF`
- Deciphered Message: `SECRET MESSAGE`
