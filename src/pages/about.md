# Rules and Challenge Details

## WARNING

Do not share answers to problems. Doing so lowers your own chances of winning, as well as the chances of others who have earned their points in an honest manner. **Someone who is found to have obtained from or shared answers to someone else will be immediately disqualified!**

## Parts, Schedule

The Cryptography Challenge is a collection of challenges related to cryptography. The distribution of said challenges is divided into three parts, each with a different number of sub-challenges:

* Part 1 runs from February 1st to February 22nd and offers an Easy-level challenge.
* Part 2 runs from February 22nd to March 14 and offers both an Easy and Medium-level challenge.
* Part 3 runs from March 14 to April 4 and offers an Easy, Medium, and Hard challenge.

## Description

Based on the difficulty of the challenges, you may obtain a different number of points. As a contestant you may take any number of challenges, but you may only obtain points from a specific challenge once. Once all three parts of the Cryptography Challenge are finished, contestants are entered into specific "tiers" based on the number of points they collected. Higher tiers offer rewards of higher value, and thus is an incentive for contestants to push themselves and take on harder challenges. The rewards will be randomly awarded to contestants of that tier, this ensures that even contestants who are unfamiliar with ciphers and may not place very high in the leaderboard will still have a chance to win a prize, albeit a lower-value one compared to the higher tiers.

## Point System

Challenges are worth the following number of points:

* Easy: 10 Points
* Medium: 16 Points
* Hard: 40 points

The minimum number of points required to enter each tier are:

* Tier 1: 36 Points
* Tier 2: 60 Points
* Tier 3: 82 Points
