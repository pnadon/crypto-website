# Rules and Challenge Details

The Cryptography Challenge is a collection of challenges related to cryptography. The distribution of said challenges is divided into three parts, each with a different number of sub-challenges:
- Part 1 runs from February 1st to February 22nd and offers an Easy-level challenge.
- Part 2 runs from February 22nd to March 14 and offers both an Easy and Medium-level challenge.
- Part 3 runs from March 14 to April 4 and offers an Easy, Medium, and Hard challenge.

Based on the difficulty of the challenges, you may obtain a different number of points. As a contestant you may take any number of challenges, but you may only obtain points from a specific challenge once. Once all three parts of the Cryptography Challenge are finished, contestants are entered into specific "tiers" based on the number of points they collected. Higher tiers offer rewards of higher value, and thus is an incentive for contestants to push themselves and take on harder challenges.
