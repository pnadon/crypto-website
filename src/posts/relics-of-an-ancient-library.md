# Challenge

If you haven’t done the Round 3 Easy and Medium challenges first, please do so for the story to make sense!

**Congratulations!! It's awesome that you could make it this far. Unfortunately a last leg of deciphering is still left, So welcome to the final chapter!!!**

Members of the cryptography project have received an intel that the last piece of the puzzle, the fuel for the ship, is hidden inside an ancient library. You being the smartest have been chosen to complete this task. After travelling for 3 days you finally find the library. The moment you walk in, you observe greek letters on the walls which looks like a direction to something. You follow the path and find a telephone directory. You observe that the book is something more than just a directory so, you read the title out loud to understand what it means:

> “The triplets
> **laala allal laaaa aaaaa aalll
> allaa aalaa laall alaaa alaaa alall
> alaal aalaa laala laall laall alaaa alall**
> together is a path to an ancient method.”

What kind of a title is this, you think?
You open the book and a folded page slips down. You pick up the page and observe that it has numbers and dots embedded on it which are aligned symmetrically. You look carefully and see something like this:

```
 5     4     3     3     4     7     6     8     2     5     
...   ...   ...    ..   ...   ....   ..    .     .    ...  

9     2     9     7     3     2     7     9     2     8  
.     .    ...   ....   ..    .    ....  ...    ..    ..     

8     4     8     7     7     4     6     7     5     3
.    ...    .   ....  ....   ...    .     .    ...    ..  
```

After brainstorming for a while, you note down what the title and the numbers might decipher to and move forward.
The greek letters on the wall further lead you to a giant vault which presumably has what you were looking for, the fuel!!
You then notice a small message on the front panel of the vault which says:

> “Encryption is the key to where everything started and how it happened.” 

What is this message, is it some kind of hint or a path to crack the password of the vault?
 
You are one step away to escape the doomed earth. Now it is all about making the right choice and thinking out of the box. You understand that at this point everything may not make sense and things might mislead but it is what it is, so you need to be confident about your approach.
