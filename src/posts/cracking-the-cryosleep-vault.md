# Challenge

If you haven’t done the Round 3 Easy challenge first, please do so for the story to make sense!

About 3 weeks ago, members of the Cryptography Project had uncovered another ship, although this one was damaged beyond repair aside from some fully-charged cryosleep capsules (battery-sized tubes which provide the freezing agent used for the cryosleep pods). Since the ship we found in the previous round was missing cryosleep capsules, some members began moving the capsules into an old underground vault which had been secured by a voice-activated password (which had been discovered by accident), so that they can later be loaded into the ship when it is time to go.

Unfortunately, the members responsible for moving the cryosleep to the vault went missing, presumably caught by some aliens. For safety’s sake the password to the vault was never written down or mentioned to any other members, however a clue was left behind near the vault.

You have been sent out to try and decipher this clue, and report back so that members may begin loading the capsules into the functional ship.
When you arrive at the site, you look around for the clue, until you notice a phrase written in the ceiling:

`difficult to glean info? even that oddness must mean somethin... no one asks why he came from, oh and where did he go to, that cotton eye joe, so elusive and so mysterious, lest joe come hither and explains thoroughly…`

Followed by a strange sequence of numbers:

`13 21 14 33 23 43 21 13 23 43 12 42 23`

Determined to crack this puzzle, you sit down and begin to think…
