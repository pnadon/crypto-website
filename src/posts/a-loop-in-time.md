# Challenge

You and your fellow members of the Cryptography Project were taking a break, when suddenly someone runs up to you, and announces that the project will be performing a screening of members, before we all board the ship and leave Earth. The purpose of the screening is to filter out any aliens who have disguised themselves as humans using an advanced form of alien camouflage.

To screen out aliens, the members of the challenge are passing out a test which only humans should be able to understand, given that aliens don’t seem to understand ciphers very well. A member hands the challenge to you, which looks like the following:

*It wa**s** the year 2020. **M**ost students were **i**nside on accoun**t** of t**h**e terribl**y** **co**l**d** w**e**ather.* 
*The time was 17:03. It was already **q**uite **d**ark outside. The meeting fo**r** the cryptography club was running late. At 17:05, when every**o**ne was about to leave the rende**z**vous, an unu**s**ual thin**g** happened. All the **f**ire alarm**s** on campus went off at once, everyone's phones started buzzing fro**m** the emer**g**ency alert that was sent **o**ut. The pani**c** was visib**l**e on everyone's faces.*
*The time's 17:06, the power went off, unsettling d**a**rkness fille**d** every corner and nook of the city. The **d**rea**d**ful n**o**ir was prevale**nt** throughout the **sub**urbs, **t**o**r**menting those who l**ac**ked ba**t**teries.*
