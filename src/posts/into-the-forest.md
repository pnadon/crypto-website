*If you haven’t done the Round 2 Easy challenge first, please do so for the story to make sense!*

A team from the Cryptography Project has just found the coordinates of a planet that could possibly help save the human race. You decide to camp at the outskirts of a nearby forest to avoid any dangers of being in the open. It has been multiple days without any activity, and you ponder upon what should be done next. It begins raining and you seek shelter under the branches of a fallen tree.

"Hey, did you hear about the rumours of a crazy old man who lives in this forest? Spends his days rambling about secret codes and spaceships..." One of your members says. Just then you notice something written on the bark of the tree:

`AVLIIEAUNFTVEVSEEOEINHFREITBSS`

Just below the writing is a weird drawing, carved deep into the tree:

"Yep, that old man is nuts!" Another member adds, laughing. "Hold on..." You reply, "Maybe we could check it out. Who knows, the old man could know something we don't!"

Since there is currently nothing else to do, you team decides to pursue this idea. You wonder what the message signifies and keep a record of it in your journal. You continue going deeper into the forest and come across a small clear area without trees or plantation. It is midday now and the sun is right above you. You see the sunlight pointing towards the centre of the clearing as if almost made to do so. You go to the centre and find an oddly out-of-place sign:

The sign appears to have a weird line of characters in it’s lower-right corner:

`KBGIH DKHFDIBF LGHF NBKCM BGHI`

Something’s weird about that photo, eh? Confused as to how to proceed with this information, you confer with the other surviving members and try to crack what the code could mean…

**Hint: one of the ciphers used are *not* listed in the [Resources](/resources) page! Look for clues, and use a search engine to research the solution!**
