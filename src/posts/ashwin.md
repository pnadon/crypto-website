* Sudoku / magic square
* * * Sudoku: common
    * Magic square:![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/imNI4cwdOIQwmUby5uFItVNFsjcuNvwzm6TcA7zD63KM2bKJbHAxIieU8QwwU4xStQj2bMLqW69JzK6Kb8AFkEMJmo_mHW9dGITXIW9Zte9Vr9bLXMz10oVTJBPkLoYuRgl9Uh_M)
  * Embed puzzle in blog post, post key at bottom, use segment of puzzle as array of numbers which correspond to positions of characters in text, apply key to characters to get message
  * Hint at how to use answer to puzzle, and apply to blog post

1. Morse code, using an element in the blog post (eg gif of character, picture, etc.)
2. 1. Blog post describes a story, which at some point hints at morse code (eg. “a code which used different signal durations”),
   2. 1. Apply timing of element to morse code, then use morse code to get message
   3. Morse code in the open, decode using the international morse code to the ciphertext (a string of alphabet which makes no sense)
   4. 1. [story v1.1](https://drive.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/open?id=1RMcc67ow05hEJxcYk6bHg7WNJUfzuDQURH9tDRaRxGU)

* Vigenere
* * Use repetitive phrases / text to hint at key
  * Blog post content is historical story, hints at vigenere
* Polyalphabetic Cipher
* Maybe for easy/medium use of early cryptography techniques
* For hard, relatively new ciphers.
* For a medium level problem, we can use the polyalphabetic cipher. So this cipher involves a common key… for example:
