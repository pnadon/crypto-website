# Challenge

Humanity is hanging by the last thread. Survival is getting more and more difficult everyday. You are now a part of ‘The Cryptography Project’, a project which is made up of a few people still alive. You have been split into teams, and the one that you are part of has been assigned to look into the recent findings of a strange scientist, Doc. Vader. Doc. Vader claims to have found some information regarding an inhabitable planet from some ancient texts of the year 2025, which could potentially offer a solution to humanity’s bleak present.

Doc. Vader resides in the old Lab in the ‘Abandoned city’, which is the only surviving structure that still holds some of the pre-apocalypse texts and information. After travelling for three days, hiding and running from the aliens, you reach the Lab at midnight to meet Doc. Vader. But all you see is his body, laying in a pool of blood. You rush to his aid, but it's too late. He points his finger towards a number plate and whispers

> “From A to T, then 0 to 9”

You go closer to the number plate and see a set of 6 characters changing in the same rhythm, just like a melody:

`74SDL7...Z4SDLZ...ZRSDLZ...ZRS9LZ...`

You sit there, holding his body. Your team has lost all hope of accomplishing their mission, you are desperately trying to figure out the meaning behind Doc. Vader’s words, when you notice something in his clenched fist. It's a piece of paper, with a message! It says:

`B0JE 2QR N8ST H6N T2`

It doesn’t make any sense at all. However, this piece of information is your last hope. Now you and your teammates have to find a way to decode this message and accomplish your mission.
