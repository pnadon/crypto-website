# Challenge

Humanity is hanging by the last thread. Survival is getting more and more difficult everyday. You are now a part of ‘The Cryptography Project’, a project which is made up of a few people still alive. You have been split into teams, and the one that you are part of has been assigned to look into the recent findings of a strange scientist, Doc. Vader. Doc. Vader claims to have found some information regarding an inhabitable planet from some ancient texts of the year 2025, which could potentially offer a solution to humanity’s bleak present.

Doc. Vader resides in the old Lab in the ‘Abandoned city’, which is the only surviving structure that still holds some of the pre-apocalypse texts and information. After travelling for three days, hiding and running from the aliens, you reach the Lab at midnight to meet Doc. Vader.

As you walk in, you see a number plate and see a set of 6 characters changing fluidly:

`74SDL7...Z4SDLZ...ZRSDLZ...ZRS9LZ...`

You keep walking further, and see Doc. Vader in a pool of blood.

> I don't have much time left, so listen carefully! The number plate may change, but in reality it is always the same! It is the secret to uncovering my secret, which is written here..." 

He whispers, and moves his hand towards you, which holds a piece of paper. Doc. Vader coughs, and then with his last breath, mumbles

> “Not A to Z... From A to T, then 0 to 9...”

After a moment of silence, you open his hand and find a ciphertext written on it:

`B0JE 2QR N8ST H6N T2`

It doesn’t make any sense at all. However, this piece of information is your last hope. Now you and your teammates have to find a way to decode this message and accomplish your mission.

# Solving the Challenge

**MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT THE [RESOURCES](/resources) SECTION OF THE WEBSITE!**

The *two* ciphers used in this challenge are in the resources section, but one has been modified! This is to prevent people from easily using online tools, and requires a bit more thinking to solve! The tweak we have made is given as a hint from Doc. Vader in the challenge.
